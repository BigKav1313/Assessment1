Interest in IT

I really enjoy problem solving and technology so IT was a no brainer when nursing didn’t pan out. I would have to say my interest in IT started around the time my brother got his first PC back in 2006 I fell in love with video games and Technology in general. I don’t have much in the way of experience when it comes to IT. I chose to attend RMIT because a friend of mine suggested that I do my course via oua. I hope to learn the valuable skills to go forward and complete my bachelors of IT.
